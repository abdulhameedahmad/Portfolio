### Data Cleaning/Preperation


In the initial data preperation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as;

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with 

```sql

Select *
from table1

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarised as follows:

1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season. 
2. Product category A is the best performing category in terms of sales and revenue. 
3. Customer segment with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted to marketing efforts.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, We recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting product A
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.


### Limitation 

I had to remove all the zero values from budgets and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. 
There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then there is a positive corellation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
